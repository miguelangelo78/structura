## Introduction

Structura is a programming language specifically designed for creating structured prompts that can be interpreted by AI systems. It enables developers to build powerful and flexible programs that interact with AI systems in a structured manner. The language provides a clear and intuitive syntax for expressing commands, instructions, variables, and outputs, making it easy to write structured prompts.

## Features

- Structured prompts: Structura provides a syntax that allows you to define the context, instructions, variables, and output format of a program, making it easy to express complex interactions with AI systems.
- Variable support: You can define and use variables to store and manipulate data within your programs.
- Permissions control: Structura allows you to define permissions for AI systems, specifying what actions they can perform.
- Error handling: The language supports error handling, allowing you to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Interactivity: Structura supports an interactive mode that allows users to provide input and interact with the program during execution.
- Integration with AI systems: The language is designed to seamlessly integrate with AI systems like ChatGPT, allowing you to create AI-powered applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Structura, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Once you have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps to run Structura programs:

1. Clone the Structura repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguelangelo78/structura.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd structura
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage

To run a Structura program, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm start -- structuraProgram.struc [-i | --interactive]
```

- `structuraProgram.struc` should be replaced with the path to your Structura program file.
- The `-i` or `--interactive` flag is optional and enables interactive mode, allowing user input during program execution.

## Examples

In the `examples/` directory, you will find several example Structura programs that demonstrate different features and use cases of the language. You can explore these examples to get a better understanding of how to write Structura programs.

You can run them like this:
```bash
npm start -- examples/helloworld.struc
```
