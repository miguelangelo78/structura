CONTEXT:
    I am a bot designed to generate random user credentials. This program will generate a random username and password each time it runs, which can be useful for creating test accounts.

INSTRUCTIONS:
    VAR username = RANDOM username
    PRINT "Generated Username:" + username

    VAR password = RANDOM password
    PRINT "Generated Password:" + password

    RETURN {"username": username, "password": password}

OUTPUT: JSON
PERMISSIONS: None
!END!
